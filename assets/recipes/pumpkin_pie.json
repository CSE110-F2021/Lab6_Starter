Then after 15 minutes, lower the temperature to 350°F. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes more. The pie is done when a knife tip inserted in the center comes out wet but relatively clean. The center should be just barely jiggly. (About half-way through the baking, you may want to put foil around the edges or use a pie protector to keep the crust from getting too browned.) Note that the pumpkin pie will come out of the oven all puffed up (from the leavening of the eggs), and will deflate as it cools."

When I saw that Sainsbury's sell pumpkin puree I decided to try making one.\nI'm not much of a cook so it looked funny, and my kitchen is wreaked, but it still tasted great!"

My family is obsessed with chocolate chip cookies üç™ and I‚Äôve been experimenting with millions of recipes. I‚Äôve always thought it‚Äôs boring to stick to one recipe, but this is my permanent recipe. I sometimes cut out the sugar, strangely, it tastes amazing that way! I usually skip the part about leaving it in a container for a week (my family eats it up right Away! üòÑ) my family likes more cookie-dough type cookies (gooey) so we totally skip that step. And they‚Äôre just so good you eat them right away! I never buy in-salted butter so I just use salted butter and cut down on the salt (turns out great still!) all in all, this recipe is absolutely the best I‚Äôve ever come across in years of making cookies. Ive never loved a cookie better! :-)",

They don't spread out too much on the pan, so you can actually put them a little closer together than regular cookies. They taste great too!",

After a healthful dinner of kale and quinoa, my sister and I decided to indulge in the decadence of chocolate chip cookies, trusting only Martha herself to direct our baking. We used the correct measurements but melted the butter for a bit too long. We thought, \"This is no problem, our fearless, wise teacher will not fail us.\"  We were gravely mistaken. Our dough has the consistency of batter and stuck to our fingers like some ungodly things I don't want to mention on such a pristine website. Our cookies took hours to bake (figuratively of course) as we waited in anticipation to see what masterpiece we had created. Upon opening the oven, we discovered that our cookies had merged into a colossal flat cookie! We broke it into chunks and mixed it with ice cream and voil la! We realized that Martha had not led us astray, but took us on another journey we had not expected. All hail Martha.",

I do know that you have to be careful that you're using 2 STICKS, not 2 cups of butter. (2 sticks= 1cup). Also, some people don't know what creaming butter means. It does take a good 4-5 minutes of beating to get it creamed properly- this lends the cookie the spread and the chewiness it needs.\nI wonder if the person with a cakey texture to the cookie used baking powder instead of baking soda. Baking powder makes things puff up- baking soda makes them spread. Make sure you're using the right thing!\nI almost always have great results with Martha recipes, and I follow the recipes to a T.",

I mixed the butter and both the sugars until the mixture was soft (it still had bits of solid sugar in it though), I then added the vanilla (mine was powdered vanilla), salt and three eggs (my eggs were small). I mixed it until it was soft (this time i could see less bits of sugar). \n\nI added the flour-baking soda mixture in by small portions and mixed until it was well combined. Unlike the recipe, I didn't preheat my oven. I left it on for about 5 mins before putting in the first batch of cookies. I left them cook for 14 mins in total before taking them out and letting them cool completely on the baking tray. \n\nI expected the second batch to take less time in the oven but it actually took more (since they were bigger than the first batch), they were in the oven for around 17-19 mins then I took them out and left them cool. I made 28 cookies in total (you'd probably make more if you used an icecream scoop to have them the same size).\n\nThey're fantastic, a bit too sweet for my taste but great nonetheless. The edge was crispy and the middle was soft and chewy!",

Just make sure you follow directions and while the mixer is spinning in slow speed, place the flour slowly with the s[filtered]. That is one idea.

Someone here was asking if they can be made vegan while chewy...i will try to figure it out and see what i can come up with. I would say, just play with ingredients.

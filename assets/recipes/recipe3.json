Although it may not be the healthiest, use medium ground beef for moistness & flavour. The leaner varieties produce burgers that are drier with a denser, tighter texture. Don't use previously frozen meat as juices are lost during defrosting. If making ahead, cover with plastic wrap & refrigerate for no more than a day. Enjoy!","image":"https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/q_92,fl_progressive,w_1200,c_scale/v1/img/recipes/92/02/1/ArhyYe9RTCrWPsuTu5hw_0S9A9973.jpg","recipeCategory":"Meat","keywords":"Kid Friendly,Spring,Summer,Camping,< 30 Mins,Easy,Inexpensive","recipeIngredient":["1       egg","1   teaspoon    mustard (regular or Dijon)","1   teaspoon    Worcestershire sauce","1   small    onion, finely grated ","1   clove    garlic, minced ","1/2  teaspoon    salt","1/2  teaspoon    pepper","1   lb   medium ground beef","1   tablespoon   creamy caesar salad dressing or 1   tablespoon    Greek salad dressing","1   tablespoon   chopped sun-dried tomato","1   tablespoon    sour cream or 1   tablespoon    yoghurt","1   tablespoon   grated fresh lemon rind or 1   tablespoon    lime rind","1   tablespoon   grated gingerroot","1   tablespoon    ketchup or 1   tablespoon    barbecue sauce","1   teaspoon    lemon pepper","1   teaspoon    curry powder","1   teaspoon    dried thyme or 1   teaspoon    dried rosemary","1   tablespoon    fresh herb","2   teaspoons    cajun seasoning","1   teaspoon    sesame oil","1   teaspoon    teriyaki sauce or 1   teaspoon    hoisin sauce","1       fresh jalapenos or 1       pickled jalapeno pepper, chopped "],"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingValue":"5.0","reviewCount":"189"},"nutrition":{"@type":"NutritionInformation","calories":"320.4","fatContent":"22.3","saturatedFatContent":"7.9","cholesterolContent":"126.6","sodiumContent":"575.5","carbohydrateContent":"5.5","fiberContent":"1.1","sugarContent":"2.8","proteinContent":"23.6"},"recipeInstructions":[{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Lightly oil grill& heat BBQ to medium."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Whisk egg in a bowl& add next 6 ingredients."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Add any of the &#x93;stir-ins&#x94; that appeal to you."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Crumble in beef& using your hands or a fork, gently mix together."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Handle the meat as little as possible &#x96; the more you work it, the tougher it gets."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Gently shape (don&#x92;t firmly press) mixture into burgers about &#xBE; inch thick."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Using your thumb, make a shallow depression in the centre of each burger to prevent puffing up during cooking."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Place burgers on the grill, close lid& BBQ until NO LONGER PINK INSIDE, turning once, about 6 &#x96; 8 minutes per side."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"An instant read thermometer should read 160F."},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Don't abuse your burgers by pressing with a spatula, pricking with a fork or turning frequently as precious juices will be lost!"},{"@type":"HowToStep","text":"Tuck into a warm crusty bun& add your favourite toppings."}],"recipeYield":"4 serving(s)","review":[{"@type":"Review","description":"I have no idea why the first review said they couldn&#039;t get this to stick together on the grill.   Be gentle with the meat and leave it alone while it is on the grill.  Don&#039;t pat, poke, or flip it more than once.  I did this recipe as stated with no extra add ins.  The result was simply burger heaven.  This was the first time I attempted to prepare my own patties.  I will never by the frozen junk again.  This is too easy to make and adds a whole new definition of burger.  This was the best burger I have ever had!","datePublished":"October 18, 2015","itemReviewed":{"@type":"Thing","name":"The Perfect Burger"},"reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":"1","ratingValue":5,"bestRating":"5"},"author":"stinsniper .."}],"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Food.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://geniuskitchen.sndimg.com/fdc-new/img/FDC-Logo.png"},"url":"https://www.food.com"}}
